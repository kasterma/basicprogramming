# Basic Programming

Work and play to improve my basic programming abilities.  I currently think of
this as work in three very broadly construed areas:

1. Algorithms
2. Languages
3. Libraries

In the Algorithms area I think of general knowledge of algorithms, data
structures, and patterns.

In the Languages area I think of good familiarity with a couple of different
languages.

In the Libraries area I am thinking of good familiarity with some general use
libraries as well as intimate familiarity with a couple of essential
libraries.

Aside from reading and implementing I also plan to be active on sites like
hackerrank.
